# GloVe-Implementation
GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for generating vector representations for words. Training is done using a co-occcurence matrix from a corpus. The resulting representations contain structure useful for many other tasks. 

Base Paper underlying the methodology:
https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf

Current Implementation is in PyTorch.

Currently WIP - Data Preparation steps are not here.
