# GloVe---Implementation
GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for generating vector representations for words. Training is done using a co-occcurence matrix from a corpus. The resulting representations contain structure useful for many other tasks.  The paper describing the model is here.  The original implementation for this Machine Learning model can be found here.
