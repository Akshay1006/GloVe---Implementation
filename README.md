# GloVe---Implementation
GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for generating vector representations for words. Training is done using a co-occcurence matrix from a corpus. The resulting representations contain structure useful for many other tasks. 

Base Paper underlying the methodology:

Current Implementation is in PyTorch.

Currently WIP - Data Preparation steps are not here.
